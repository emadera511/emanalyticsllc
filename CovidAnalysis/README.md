For this challenge I will be analysis the data provided on this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress

A brief description on the data: 

Data is collected daily from Our World in Data GitHub repository for covid-19, merged and uploaded. Country level vaccination data is gathered and assembled in one single file. Then, this data file is merged with locations data file to include vaccination sources information. A second file, with manufacturers information, is included.

## Summary 

For this data set although in Kaggle there are two dataset I only concentrated in one the country_vaccinations.csv. 

In this dataset there are few fields that I can extract information on.  

## Technology Used.  

To showcase my pyspark skill i used pyspark, in conjunction with pandas.  From a pyspark perspective the I used the dataframe api and the spark.sql api as well.  From a data visualization perspective I have used seaborn to plot the data.
